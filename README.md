# Pokedex

This project is inspired by the [Ricardo Schiniegoski Figma Design](https://www.figma.com/design/56C81JSVaxrEUpXVgGyy1h/Pok%C3%A9dex-(Community)?node-id=0-1&t=fVZ0KEhBWg8o6qaB-0). It served as a valuable learning experience for me, particularly in understanding the power and flexibility of TanStack Router and Query.

## Overview

The project aims to demonstrate how TanStack Router and Query can be used as lightweight alternatives to popular technologies like React Router, Next.js, and Redux. These tools offer greater flexibility and a streamlined developer experience, making them an excellent choice for modern web applications.

## Features

- TanStack Router: A powerful, flexible, and lightweight routing library that can replace more traditional solutions like React Router and Next.js. It also provides better type safety compared to Next.js, enhancing code reliability and maintainability.
- TanStack Query: An advanced data fetching and state management solution, providing a robust alternative to Redux.

## Learning Outcomes
Working on this project helped me gain a deeper understanding of:

- How to implement routing with TanStack Router.
- Managing server-state and caching with TanStack Query.
- Building flexible and efficient web applications without relying on heavier frameworks or libraries.
